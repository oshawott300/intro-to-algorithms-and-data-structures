# intro-to-algorithms-and-data-structures
All projects from Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures class.

Project 1 - Had a random number generator and found roots of an equation (Both quadratic and complex). 

Project 2 - Made a BattleShip type game that also generated a random board and randomly placed hidden boats. Kept track of how many hits/misses you had, how boats were left, and included special power-ups like a bomb that covered more space and a drone that gave out a coordinate of where the boat is.
