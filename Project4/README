We both contributed equally on all the parts. We both went to office hours if needed
and furthermore worked collaboratively through zoom on the three different methods of
this project.

Our project has two helper functions "inBounds" which checks if x and y are in bounds and
"allVisited" that checks the spaces around that space.

There aren't any known bugs/defects.
