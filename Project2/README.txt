Group members: John Lei - lei00007 and Nahum Gebremedhin - gebre109.
Both worked on the BattleBoatsBoard class and talked through every function. John wrote the code, but both still talked about how to implement the code in the class. Nahum did the testing to see if everything worked. The whole BattleBoatsBoard class was a collaborative effort. The BattleBoatsGame class was worked on partially by Nahum, but then finished by John.

How to run: just "javac BattleBoatsBoard.java" and "javac BattleBoatsGame.java" to compile. To run the game: "java BattleBoatsGame".

One minor defect would be the sinking of the boats, but it barely happens.
